## 🔐 Security Rules (Firestore)

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can read their own profile
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow write: if false; // Only admin via console
    }
    
    // Schools, classes, students
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
